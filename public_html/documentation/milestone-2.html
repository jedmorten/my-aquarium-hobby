<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>
    <h2>Navbar</h2>
    <p>At the top of my site, I will have a navbar that will navigate to specific areas of the page since the page might end up being long The navbar will move as the page is scrolled so it can be accessed at any time.</p>
    <h2>Welcome Picture/Message</h2>
    <p>Picture of my aquarium that will cover the entire width of the page. It will also display a welcome message.</p>
    <h2>Fish/Plant Carousels</h2>
    <p>The left carousel will display images of my fish. The right will display images of my live plants. </p>
    <h2>Journey Section</h2>
    <p>Section where I describe how long I've been keeping aquariums, upgrades in equipment that I've made along the way, and struggles I've had.</p>
    <h2>Journey Gallery</h2>
    <p>Gallery of photos that illustrate the journey section. The images will start with the first aquarium that I had, then the second, then the third.</p>
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p>Carousel of cards that will show the equipment that I use in my current aquarium setup.  Each card will have an image cap of the equipment piece, a small description of what it does, and a link where to buy it.</p>
    <h2>About Me/Contact ME</h2>
    <p>The left box will contain an about me section. The right box will contain a contact form.</p>
    <h2>Footer</h2>
