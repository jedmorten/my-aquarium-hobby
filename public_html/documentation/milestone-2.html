<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>At the top of my site, I will have a navbar that will navigate to specific areas of the page since the page might end up being long.</p>
    <p>Under the navbar there will be a picture of my aquarium that will cover the entire width of the page. It will also display a welcome message.</p>
    <p>Under the welcome section, there will be two picture carousels. The left carousel will display images of my fish. The right will display images of my live plants. </p>
    <p>Under the two carousels, there will be a text section where I describe how long I've been keeping aquariums, and the upgrades in equipment that I've made along the way.</p>
    <p>Next will be a gallery of photos that illustrate the journey section. The images will start with the first aquarium that I had, then the second, then the third.</p>
    <p>After the Journey gallery, I will use a carousel of cards that will show the equipment that I use in my current aquarium setup.  Each card will have an image cap of the equipment piece, a small description of what it does, and a link where to buy it.</p>
    <p>The next section will be a container with two boxes. The left box will contain a contact form, and the right box will contain an about me section.</p>
    <p>Lastly, there will be a footer at the bottom of the page with some sort of parting information in it.</p>
